    <p>Monday blues are difficult to kill but anything is possible with cute videos of dogs. An absolutely adorable video of a puppy enjoying his first snow is doing the rounds of social media and we bet you will watch it on loop. An Instagram account called Pups Of Golden posted the short clip of the puppy and it has gone viral on the internet.

WHAT DOES THE VIRAL VIDEO SHOW?

This puppy, a furry Golden Retriever, is called Sterling Newton. In the clip, Sterling, seated in front of his residence, enjoyed the snowfall and also licked off the snowflakes from his body. Of course, Sterling loved it as he played and rolled around in the snow-covered path outside his home.

"Baby Sterling's first snow," is the caption of the post</p>
